# TaskTrackerAlt

the difficulty with this new  project were things such as figuring out how to get the
data to store and allow it to be edited. Local storage is something i also dont fully grasp and by that i mean accessing it, while i do understand the concept of it accessing it and using it in this way for the project was one of my biggest difficulties i would say that i struggled with.
